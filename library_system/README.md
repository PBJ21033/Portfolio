# Overview
This web app allows a user to add, delete, issue, and return library books. This app is assuming that the user is a librarian (since they are the only ones that can add a book). To start a test server on your computer all you need is to install node.js. Then you need to go to the library_system directory from your terminal. From there all you need to input is "node app.js" and press enter. The app will then be running but won't open anything. You then need to go to your web browser and type: "localhost:5500". After this you are good to go!

This software was created so that I could learn how to use node.js and express.js to create a web app. I have also been interested on what might go into developing a web app for a library. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* I need to add a database of some sort. (either cloud or MySQL)
* I need to add more css to make the pages look better. 
* I need to add a way to login to the system which will determine if you can add a book or just checkout and return books.
