# Overview


## Description of the app:
    This app was written in React Native with Node as the Backend. To use the app you must install react native onto your computer.
    Then you need to download the expo app on your phone which will allow you to display the app on your phone.

## Purpose of the app:
    The purpose of this app was so that I could learn how to create a mobile app using React Native. I also wanted to learn how 
    Recipe apps worked so that I could add upon this app to build my own fully functional recipe app.
