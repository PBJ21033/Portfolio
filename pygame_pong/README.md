# Overview
## Description of the Game
 I wrote a game called pong in pygame. To play the game you just need to run the code to start out. To move your paddle, you need to press the 'w' key for up and the 's' key for down.
 If you miss the ball (opponent scores), the game ends and you lose. If you score then you win and the game ends. 

## Purpose

I wrote this software to learn a little bit about game devlopment and to see how pygame works. 

## Demo

# Development Environment

## Tools Used
The tools that I used for this was:
- Visual studio code

## Languages and Libraries

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* An add on that would be cool is saving the game state to a file.
* Another add on would be creating different leves.
* Another possibility for this project is Reinforcement Learning.
